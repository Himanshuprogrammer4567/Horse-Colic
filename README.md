Predicting the survival of horse
Predict whether or not a horse can survive based upon past medical conditions.
Noted by the "outcome" variable in the data.
All of the binary representation have been converted into the words they actually represent. However, a fuller description is provided by the data dictionary (datadict.txt).

There are a lot of NA's in the data. This is the real struggle here. Try to find a way around it through imputation or other means.
